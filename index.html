  <h1>Grasshopper Jungle</h1><p>I read this for school when I was younger. It <strong> really stuck out </strong>.It's quite an odd story and I really enjoyed this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasshopper_Jungle">book</a>. The author,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_A._Smith">Andrew Smith</a> has written a variety of other works that I've been meaning to check out
  </a>.</p> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2f/Grasshopperjungle.jpg" alt="Grass Hopper Jungle book cover art">
